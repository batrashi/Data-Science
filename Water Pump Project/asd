Your goal is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset. You are provided the following set of information about the waterpoints: 
amount_tsh - Total static head (amount water available to waterpoint)
date_recorded - The date the row was entered
funder - Who funded the well
gps_height - Altitude of the well
installer - Organization that installed the well
longitude - GPS coordinate 
latitude - GPS coordinate
wpt_name - Name of the waterpoint if there is one
num_private - 
basin - Geographic water basin
subvillage - Geographic location
region - Geographic location
region_code - Geographic location (coded)
district_code - Geographic location (coded)
lga - Geographic location
ward - Geographic location
population - Population around the well
public_meeting - True/False
recorded_by - Group entering this row of data
scheme_management - Who operates the waterpoint
scheme_name - Who operates the waterpoint
permit - If the waterpoint is permitted
construction_year - Year the waterpoint was constructed
extraction_type - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
extraction_type_group - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
extraction_type_class - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
management - How the waterpoint is managed
management_group - How the waterpoint is managed
payment - What the water costs
payment_type - What the water costs
water_quality - The quality of the water
quality_group - The quality of the water
quantity - The quantity of water
quantity_group - The quantity of water
source - The source of the water
source_type - The source of the water
source_class - The source of the water
waterpoint_type - The kind of waterpoint
waterpoint_type_group - The kind of waterpoint

The labels in this dataset


Distribution of Labels
The labels in this dataset are simple. There are three possible values:
functional - the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
functional needs repair - the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
non functional - the waterpoint is not operational

Submission format

The format for the submission file is simply the row id and the predicted label (for an example, see SubmissionFormat.csv on the data download page.

For example, if you just predicted that all the waterpoints were functional you would have the following predictions: 
id
status_group
50785
functional
51630
functional
17168
functional
45559
functional
49871
functional
Your .csv file that you submit would look like:
id,status_group
50785,functional
51630,functional
17168,functional
45559,functional
...
Good luck!
